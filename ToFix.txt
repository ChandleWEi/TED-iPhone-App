The table view for the Speakers is being cropped at the bottom. I think this is because the xib for the page is a bit confused with a view that has a navigation controller added to it. This probably needs reworking to allow the table to autoresize itself correctly.

We should probably internationalise the app and get all the text strings into a localized file for future proofing.

If there is any chance that the images will change in the future, or the id's reused, we need a way to purge the cache of images.

We could really do with caching the speakers JSON and the web content too, in some semi-permanent way.

We need to support all orientations for the iPad
